Abstract


Speech recognition technology enables computers and devices to interpret and process human speech, converting spoken language into text. Over the years, advancements in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing (NLP) have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of speech recognition systems. These systems typically involve the processes of sound wave analysis, feature extraction, acoustic modeling, and language modeling to understand spoken input. The development of neural networks, especially deep neural networks (DNNs), has played a crucial role in improving recognition performance across various languages, accents, and environments. Speech recognition has found applications in a wide range of industries, from virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to healthcare, transcription services, and customer support. However, challenges such as noise reduction, speaker variability, and context comprehension remain key areas for future research. The continued evolution of speech recognition holds the promise of more seamless and intuitive human-computer interaction across diverse domains.
